An overview of sources used in my project. 
I got my first graph from 'The Murder Accountability Project' which studied the FBI's data. I only took the values from the tibble I wanted and left values that are unnecessary for my graph. An example conists of unsolved cases as I only wanted to show the clearance rates.
