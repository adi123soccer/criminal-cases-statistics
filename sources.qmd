An overview of sources used in my project. 
In compiling data for this project, I utilized multiple sources. The first and last graph draws from ['The Murder Accountability Project,'](https://projectcoldcase.org/cold-case-homicide-stats/) which extensively analyzed FBI data. [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/track-solved-murder-rates-united-states-n1271928) contributed data for two additional graphs, all predating 2020 and sourced from FBI Records. ChatGPT played a crucial role by assisting in debugging code for graph generation.
